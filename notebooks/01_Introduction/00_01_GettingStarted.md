# Introduction

## Philosophy of the course
Numerous scientific problems can only be addressed through modeling and computer analysis. This stems from the fact that a lot of these problems are complex and the corresponding models cannot be solved using only pen-and-paper. 

Many models appearing in engineering or physical applications are mathematically described by partial differential equations (PDE) and the aim of this course is to provide a practical introduction to the relevant tools to solve them. By practical we mean that we will not develop the theory behind PDEs and also avoid complex mathematical derivations of the numerical methods we describe below. Although these are beautiful subjects, they are often characterized by a steep learning curve and our objective is to get our hands on solving real problems as quickly as possible. In some places we nevertheless provide some mathematical background about the techniques we describe because they cannot be properly understood otherwise. In each case, we try to keep things simple and written in such a way that the corresponding section may be skipped at first reading.

## Outline
To be written

## Python and why Python

All the pieces of code written in this course are written in Python. However, we try to make the required prior knowledge of Python as little as possible and the reader is only expected to have a basic knowledge of any programming language and be familiar with concepts like variables, loops, conditional statements, functions etc.
